# Back-end/Data scientist Challenge - Pickcells

## X-ray analysis and pneumonia detection:

ScanHealth is a web application that offers free pneumonia diagnosis. The client only needs to upload an x-ray photo of the chest region and wait a few moments for the diagnosis. No need to worry, ScanHealth will analyze the x-ray with discretion and guarantee the patient's anonymity.

The web application was developed as part of the challenge proposed by PickcellsÂ® for the Back-end + Data science job.

## Build

The project was developed in <i>Python3.6</i>. Docker and Docker-compose are necessary for the next steps.

#### Change to main folder:

```
  cd scan-health
```

#### Build, start and attach containers for the service:

```
  docker-compose up --build
```
